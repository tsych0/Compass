# 🥇 Compass — Competitive Programming Assistant for macOS

**Compass** is a macOS-native app (built with SwiftUI) designed to streamline your competitive programming workflow.  
It integrates with existing tools like **[Competitive Companion](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion)** and **[cp-submit](https://github.com/tsych0/cp-submit)**, while adding automation, problem tracking, and contest reminders — all in one place.

## ✨ Features

- 📥 **Competitive Companion integration** — Import problem title, link, and test cases directly.  
- 📂 **Templated file creation** — Automatically create solution files using [Stencil](https://stencil.fuller.li/) templates.  
- 🛠 **Code modification hooks** — Modify source code before run/submission, with support for embedding external files.  
- 🧪 **Sandboxed execution** — Detects available languages, runs in isolation, compares output vs. expected, enforces time limits.  
- ⚡ **Auto-run on save** (default enabled), **Auto-submit on AC pretests** (disabled by default).  
- 🔗 **IDE integration** — Automatically open solution file in your chosen editor.  
- 🌐 **Submission support** — Works with [cp-submit](https://github.com/tsych0/cp-submit) browser extension.  
- ⏱ **Inbuilt stopwatch** — Starts when a solution file is created.  
- 📊 **Problem tracking** — Keeps log of solved/DNF problems with time spent.  
- ⏰ **Smart reminders** — Alerts you when you’ve spent too long on a single problem (configurable threshold).  
- 📅 **Contest tracking** — Shows ongoing/upcoming contests using [clist.by](https://clist.by/).  
- 🔨 **Stress testing framework** — Evaluate time complexity by generating randomized test cases.
